% Simple example to show how to build all the matrices of interest (both
% for the dynamics and for the constraints) for a single network component.
% The idea can be easily extended to more network components using
% horizontal concatenation for the constraints that couple different
% network components, and a block diagonal structure for teh dynamics and
% the other constraints
